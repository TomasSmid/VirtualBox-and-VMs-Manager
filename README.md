# VirtualBox-and-VMs-Manager

This project is intended to be a java library for remote control of virtual machines via VirtualBox and its interface. Therefore, the aim of this project is to provide simply reusable java code, which would ensure functionality for principal operations with virtual machines like start-up, powering off, cloning and more. Furthermore, this functionality should be possible perform remotely with some restrictions.

To sum up, with this java library should be possible to work with VirtualBox and virtual machines simpler, clearer and more comfortable.

This project is intended to be an implementation part of bachelor thesis.
